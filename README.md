**Title:** Market Segmentation Example using K-Means Clustering

**Description:**
---
Explore market segmentation using K-Means clustering with this practical example. The project demonstrates the
application of clustering techniques to group customers based on satisfaction and loyalty scores. The code utilizes
Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn.

**Key Features:**

- **Data Loading:** Import and load market data from a CSV file for analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Create scatter plots to visualize the distribution of satisfaction and loyalty scores.
- **Clustering with K-Means:** Implement K-Means clustering to group customers into distinct segments.
- **Standardization of Variables:** Standardize input variables to ensure consistent scaling.
- **Elbow Method:** Utilize the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for segmentation.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Explore clustering solutions, visualize results, and select the appropriate number of
  clusters.
- **GitHub Repository Structure:** Clearly organized structure for easy navigation and understanding.

**How to Use:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter, VSCode).
3. Execute each step of the code to understand the market segmentation process.
4. Experiment with the number of clusters using the Elbow method and observe the clustering results.
5. Gain insights into customer segments based on satisfaction and loyalty.

**Note:** For optimal visualization and interaction, consider using Jupyter notebooks or an interactive Python
environment.
